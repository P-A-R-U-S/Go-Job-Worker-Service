## Purpose 

This software design document describes the architecture and system design
for job worker service (JobWorker) that enables authorized users run arbitrary 
Linux command on remote hosts.

## Requirements/Scope 
The project should be composed of three components:

* **Library** - reusable Go library that provide base functionality to start/stop 
    and query status of the job, as well as able to stream the output generated by the job. 
    The library should support multiple concurrent clients simultaneously and the job output 
    availability should be limited by client permission. Each job should be assigned to it own CPU, 
    Memory and DiskIO groups to limit process resource consumptions. 

* **API** - [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) API server side application that enables mTLS client authentication
  and verify client certificate. API should handle and report clear errors and not crash under non-critical 
  conditions.

  _**Note:**_ set up strong set of cipher suites for TLS and good crypto setup for certificates.

  _**Warning:**_ not any other authentication protocols should be used on top of mTLS. 

* **Client** - the client should be deigned as command line interface (cli) and connect to the API 
  and provide same set of operation (start/stop/query status/stream output of the job)

_**Note:** Golang language proposed team as preferable_
